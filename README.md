# Economic-Complexity
This repository contains the procedure for estimating the economic complexity index of Huasmann & Hidalgo (2009) using eigenvectors. The database used was obtained from Harvard Dataverse (HS4 Rev. 92) of world exports at the product level.

In addition, the methodology proposed by Koch (2021) to estimate a complexity index with export value added data is developed. In this case, the database used was created from estimates of value added in final demand, using the ICIO tables.


Finally, the estimation of an economic complexity index with subnational data is developed (in process). The database used was obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism, which contains information on exports (HS6) by region of Peru.


Note: the results have been validated, except for the subnational indicator. Anyway, use with caution. Any suggestions for improvement can be sent to me at dffjs98@gmail.com.
