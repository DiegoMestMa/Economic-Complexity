Economic Complexity
This repository contains the procedure for estimating the economic complexity index of Huasmann & Hidalgo (2009) using eigenvectors. In addition, the methodology proposed by Koch (2022) to estimate a complexity index with export value added data is developed.
Finally, the estimation of an economic complexity index with subnational data is developed (in process).
